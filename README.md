# MLEnd-Hums-and-Whistles
Deployed ML classification pipeline on MLEnd Hums &amp; Whistles Dataset.

This project deals with MLEnd Hums & Whistles Dataset, which can be found [here]. 
There are two solutions respectively, i.e, simple and advanced. The simple solution consists of binary classification in the given dataset and just deals with two categories out of all the dataset, i.e, Potter and StarWars audios.
The advanced solution deals with multi class classification pipeline using different classification techniques and all the results are compared in detail. The main focus in this solution is the cleaning and preprocessing of the dataset.
